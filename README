for this to work you will need to have vim installed in the default location on your comp.


the following items will need to be defined in your Posh profile
-for the JVPN-Connect to work you will need to set this variable up:
$global:VPN = @{'<connection name>' = '<username>'}


-for the JRemote to work you will need to set this variable up:
$global:RDC = @{
	'<servername1>' = '/v:<ip1>';
	'<servername2>' = '/v:<ip2>';
}


-you will also need to point POST_HOME to this directory:
$global:POSH_HOME = 'C:\<pathToFiles>'


to wire it all up use this:
. ($global:POSH_HOME + 'profile.ps1')
